# etch-a-sketch

In this project for the Odin Project I created a blend between a sketchpad and a etch a sketch using javascript and a css grid. I created buttons for the classic black, eraser and reset as well as a rainbow colour as a feature. I needed to make the grid resizable with a hover effect over the grid and buttons. Thi project helped me practice using grids to implement interactive features.
